## Introduction

At EcoPulp, we are change-makers committed to making a difference. We care deeply for our planet and believe in taking action to address critical environmental and social issues. Our mission is to combat climate change, reduce waste, and empower marginalized communities by turning waste paper into sustainable notebooks.

## The Need

Our world is facing a multitude of challenges, including:

- Climate change
- Soil erosion
- Flooding
- Desertification
- Loss of biodiversity
- Food insecurity
- Increase in greenhouse gases
- Loss and extinction of species

Did you know that from 2001 to 2019, a staggering 386 million hectares of forest were lost globally? Paper waste is a significant contributor to environmental problems, with paper accounting for approximately 26% of total landfill waste. Moreover, when paper rots, it emits methane gas, which is 25 times more toxic than CO2.

## Our Solution

EcoPulp offers a simple yet impactful solution. We collect waste paper, separate fresh and used pages, and create new notebooks from the unused pages. This process not only reduces waste but also provides employment opportunities to marginalized communities. We also recycle the used pages as well to create rough copies and all.

By choosing EcoPulp, you support:

- Employment generation
- Poverty reduction
- Sustainable production and consumption
- Climate action
- Environmental conservation
